Multi-Output Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Modeling with Uncertainty Quantification.

This repository provides utilities for evaluating multi-output surrogate models
with uncertainty estimation. Example notebooks in `examples/` demonstrate the
plotting functions and performance metrics. A new script `examples/generate_report.py`
shows how to create an HTML report using a Jinja2 template that collects all
metrics and figures in one document.
